  "topic": "arrays",
  "difficulty": "medium",
  "question": "What is the time complexity of finding the maximum element in an unsorted array?",
  "options": [
    "O(1)",
    "O(log n)",
    "O(n)",
    "O(n log n)"

## üß† Assessment Logic

### Scoring Algorithm
- [ ] **Topic Weight Distribution**
  - Arrays & Strings: 25%
  - Trees & Graphs: 25%
  - Dynamic Programming: 20%
  - Sorting & Searching: 15%
  - Linked Lists: 10%
  - Recursion: 5%

- [ ] **Difficulty Scoring**
  - Easy questions: 1 point
  - Medium questions: 2 points
  - Hard questions: 3 points

- [ ] **Weakness Identification**
  - Topic score < 60%: Major weakness
  - Topic score 60-75%: Minor weakness
  - Topic score > 75%: Strength

### Study Plan Generation Rules
\`\`\`javascript
// Example logic
if (topicScore < 0.6) {
  recommendations.push({
    topic: topicName,
    priority: "high",
    problems: getBeginnerProblems(topicName),
    estimatedTime: "2-3 weeks"
  });
}
\`\`\`

## ü§ñ AI Tutor Configuration

### Personality & Tone
- [ ] **Tutor Persona**: Encouraging, patient, Socratic method
- [ ] **Communication Style**: Clear explanations, step-by-step guidance
- [ ] **Difficulty Adaptation**: Adjust complexity based on user level

### Prompt Templates
\`\`\`
System: You are an algorithms tutor helping a student who scored {userScore}% on their diagnostic quiz. Their main weaknesses are: {weaknesses}. 

Provide helpful, encouraging guidance without giving away complete solutions. Use the Socratic method to guide them to understanding.

User Context: Currently working on {currentTopic}, difficulty level: {userLevel}
\`\`\`

### Response Guidelines
- [ ] **Hint System**: Progressive hints (3 levels)
- [ ] **Explanation Depth**: Beginner, intermediate, advanced
- [ ] **Code Examples**: When to show, when to withhold
- [ ] **Encouragement**: Positive reinforcement strategies

## üìä Problem Database

### Problem Categories (50-100 problems total)
