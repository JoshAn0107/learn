# üéØ MVP Project Brief: AI-Powered Learning Coach (Algorithms & Data Structures)

## ‚úÖ What the MVP Does

We're building an AI-based learning coach to help students master algorithms and data structures. The MVP focuses on:

1. **Diagnostic Quiz**
   * A set of 10‚Äì20 questions to determine user's current level
   * Multiple choice format with immediate feedback

2. **Assessment Logic**
   * Based on answers, identify strengths/weaknesses across core topics (e.g. recursion, sorting, trees)
   * Generate confidence scores per topic area

3. **Personalized Study Plan**
   * Recommend a list of topics and curated LeetCode-style problems with explanations
   * Prioritize weak areas with suggested learning sequence

4. **Basic User Progress Tracking (Optional)**
   * Save completed quizzes and suggested content per user session
   * Simple dashboard showing progress over time
